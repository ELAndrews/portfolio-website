								<h3>Professional</h3>
								<p>I will be a high performing student on the Lambda program because I have a combination of skills, passion and experience. Firstly, I have a proven ability to understand and learn technical skills having completed 2,050+ hours of study whilst in full time employment. I have retained and demonstrated these skills within formal examinations and interviews. I also have extensive experience of working in similar environments, such as high pressured roles as a shift worker and excelled. Finally, the one critical factor of my future success will be my passion for pursuing this career and commitment to achieving it. 
										<br /> <br />
										I have already dedicated 950+ hours into my future career as a developer, having achieved the first 3 certificates with freeCodeCamp: Responsive Web Design, JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures, and Front End Libraries. Additionally, I have completed 2 introductory courses with Udacity: Programming Fundamentals with Python, and HTTP and web servers.
										<br /><br />
										I have successfully complete 5 qualifications alongside full time employment, which required 600+ hours of work. I completed my Level 4 in Education and Training, including 30 observed teaching hours and 40 assignments. I have been awarded a globally respected and rigorous certification in finance and accounting with ACCA, which consists of 4 formal examinations. I attained this diploma within 50% of the guided study hours, and gained recognition for my 85%+ pass rate with a certificate of achievement. I have also obtained certifications in the arts which required approximately 500 hours of work, in similar conditions. 
										<br /><br />
										I will persevere in redirecting my career trajectory and will not be limited by location, or role specifics. Fundamentally, I am passionate about the roles that Lambda prepares students for: such as a Full-Stack Engineer, at an e-Commerce website, working with a large-scale data architecture to test and solve technical issues; Or as a Full-Stack Developer being responsible for building world-class, complete web applications. I know that programming languages continuously advance with new features. Therefore, I will make it my responsibility to keep my skills at the highest standard through continuous learning and development. I am keen to realise my ambition of becoming a Lead Developer. And I sincerely believe that the Lambda course, and its faithful replication of the collaborative working conditions, will accelerate my entry into the sector. </p>
